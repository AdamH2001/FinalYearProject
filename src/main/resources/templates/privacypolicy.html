			<h1 class="asc-header">Privacy Statement</h1>
			<p>At After School Club we respect the privacy of the children attending the Club and the privacy of their
				parents or carers. The personal information that we collect about you and your child is used only to provide
				appropriate care for them, maintain our service to you, and communicate with you effectively. Our lawful basis for
				processing the personal information relating to you and your child is so that we can fulfil our contract with you.
				Our legal condition for processing any health-related information that you provide about your child is so that we
				can provide appropriate care for that child.</p>
			<p>Any information that you provide is kept secure. Data that is no longer required* is erased after your child
				has ceased attending the Club.</p>
			<p>We will use the contact details you give us to contact you via phone, email, social media, so that we can send
				you information about your child, the Club and other relevant news, and so that we can communicate with you
				regarding payment of our fees.</p>
			<p>We will only share personal information about you or your child with another organisation if we:</p>
				<ul style="padding-left:45px">				
					<li>Have a safeguarding concern about your child</li>
					<li>Are required to by government bodies or law enforcement agencies</li>
					<li>Have obtained your prior permission</li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>You have the right to ask to see the data that we have about yourself or your child, and to ask for any errors
				to be corrected. We will respond to all such requests within one month. You can also ask for the data to be deleted,
				but note that:</p>
			<ul style="padding-left:45px">
				<li>We will not be able to continue to care for your child if we do not have sufficient information about them</li>
				<li>Even after your child has left our care, we have a statutory duty to retain some types of data for specific
					periods of time* so cannot delete everything immediately</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>If you have a complaint about how we have kept your information secure, or how we have responded to a request
				to access, update or erase your data, you can refer us to the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO).</p>
			<p>
				<i>* We do need to retain certain types of data (such as records of complaints, accidents, and attendance) for
					set periods of time after your child ceases to be in our care, but we delete as much personal data as we can as
					soon as possible.</i>
